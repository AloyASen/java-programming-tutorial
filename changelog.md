###what will i get here ?

these are the data- structures and programs developed by the use of famous libraries of the time which have been tested over time to be error free and the best part is they are free to use.

###what are the libraries used ??

these codes have used several of the standard libraries , gnu scientific library , poco native libraries , boost static headers and  also uses the dynamic libraries provided by them . there is also use of the proven datastructures as listed by the libraries themselves 

##how to go about ??

 every folder that has some code in it , has a modify.md file on for the convenience of tracking contributions and timeline ... if you find something fishy do report us at issues of this git repository we would get back to you as soon as possible and maybe resolve your issues over a cup of coffee
