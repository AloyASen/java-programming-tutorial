the main class is stored in the commencer.java file .

in this problem the solution is designed in the builder pattern where the state councils take part in the election


Input::
=========
" give the state as it takes take part in the election " 

the first letter is in caps for the state name eg. {Land} or {Air}
Output
=========



After 2 rounds of balloting if there exists a tie 
then the code will again try another round of ballot .
I can only hope that the tie is resolved after some more rounds 
or maybe the next round itself 

if it does not face the tie then it will pronounce the king and the allies of the king

Features::
============
this code is extensible and also the space kingdom can be replaced by any Kingdom

drawback
========

this code wil face a stack Overflow error if the input message contains more than 50 characters .



all the other works that require descriptions are added as comments as and where they appear in the code .
